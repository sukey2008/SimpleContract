# Simple Crypto Contract Tutorial

## Introduction

Welcome to the beginner's guide to creating a simple cryptocurrency contract using the Ethereum platform. This tutorial provides a step-by-step guide to help you understand the basics of Solidity, the primary language for Ethereum smart contracts.

## Prerequisites

1. Basic understanding of blockchain and Ethereum.
2. Familiarity with programming concepts.

## Tools and Software

1. **Remix IDE**: An open-source web and desktop application that helps in smart contract development, written in Solidity language for the Ethereum blockchain.
   - Link: [Remix IDE](https://remix.ethereum.org/)
2. **MetaMask**: A crypto wallet and gateway to blockchain apps.
   - Link: [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/)

## Steps

### 1. Setting up Remix IDE

Open Remix IDE in your browser. You should see an interface with different sections. For this tutorial, we'll focus on the "Solidity" environment.

### 2. Writing the Contract

In the Remix IDE, create a new file and name it `SimpleToken.sol`. Copy and paste the following code:

\```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract SimpleToken {
    string public name = "SimpleToken";
    string public symbol = "STK";
    uint8 public decimals = 18;
    uint256 public totalSupply;

    mapping(address => uint256) public balanceOf;

    constructor(uint256 _initialSupply) {
        totalSupply = _initialSupply * 10 ** uint256(decimals);
        balanceOf[msg.sender] = totalSupply;
    }

    function transfer(address _to, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success) {
        require(balanceOf[msg.sender] >= _value, "Not enough balance");
        balanceOf[msg.sender] -= _value;
        balanceOf[_to] += _value;
        return true;
    }
}
\```

This contract does the following:

- Defines a basic token with a name, symbol, decimals, and total supply.
- Maintains a balance for each Ethereum address.
- Allows the owner of the tokens to transfer tokens to another address.

### 3. Compile the Contract

In the Remix IDE, go to the "Solidity Compiler" section and click on the "Compile SimpleToken.sol" button. This will compile your contract and ensure there are no errors.

### 4. Deploy the Contract

1. Connect your MetaMask wallet to Remix.
2. In the "Deploy & Run Transactions" section, select the `SimpleToken` contract.
3. Enter an initial supply for your token and click "Deploy".
4. Confirm the transaction in your MetaMask popup.

Your contract is now deployed on the Ethereum blockchain!

### 5. Interacting with the Contract

Using the Remix IDE, you can call various functions of your contract, such as checking the balance of an address or transferring tokens.

## Conclusion

You've just written, compiled, and deployed a basic cryptocurrency contract on the Ethereum blockchain! This is just the beginning, and there's a lot more to explore in the world of blockchain development. Happy coding!
